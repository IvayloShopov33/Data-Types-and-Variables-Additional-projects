First project- Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is for the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors". It is pretty simple and easy to understand. You have to choose rock, paper or scissors and the computer will select also one option at random. If you beat him the output will be "You won", if you are defeated- "You lost" and it also can be a draw. If you write an invalid input, it will write out "Invalid input!" Everyone has the opportunity to use my code for free. Enjoy!

Second project- "Guess a number between 1 and 100"

This project is a game to guess one random number between 1 and 100. The number is selected at random. You have ten attempts to guess it otherwise you will lose the game. The number is always an integer and if you write an invalid input to the console, it will write out "Invalid input!". Everyone has the opportunity to use my code for free. Enjoy!
